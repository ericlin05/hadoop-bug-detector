Description

same for CompactionTxnHandler
would be convenient if the user could specify some RegEx (perhaps by db type) which will tell TxnHandler.checkRetryable() that this is should be retried.
The regex should probably apply to String produced by 

  private static String getMessage(SQLException ex) {
    return ex.getMessage() + "(SQLState=" + ex.getSQLState() + ",ErrorCode=" + ex.getErrorCode() + ")";
  }


This make it flexible.
See if we need to add Db type (and possibly version) of the DB being used.
With 5 different DBs supported this gives control end users.
