Description



hive&amp;gt; select count('1') from src group by '1';


In the above query, while performing StatsOptimizer optimization we can safely ignore the group by on the constant key '1' since the above query will return the same result as "select count('1') from src".
Exception:
If src is empty, according to the SQL standard,


 select count('1') from src group by '1'


and


 select count('1') from src


should produce 1 and 0 rows respectively.
