CREATE TABLE test(a INT, b INT, c INT)
COMMENT 'This is a test table';
hive&amp;gt;
select lead(c) over (order by (a,b)) from test limit 10;

select lead(c) over (order by a,b) from test limit 10;

Works as expected.

It appears that 'cluster by'/'sort by'/'distribute by'/'partition by' allows this:

For example, this syntax is still valid:
select lead(c) over (sort by (a,b)) from test limit 10;
