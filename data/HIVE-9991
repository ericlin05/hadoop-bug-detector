Description

I cannot do any select query on external tables that are not part of HDFS. For example S3.


Select * from my_table limit 10;

FAILED: SemanticException Unable to determine if s3n://my-bucket/is encrypted: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS: s3n://my-bucket/, expected: hdfs://0.0.0.0:8020


This error is due to a internal function that checks if a table is encrypted or not. This is only supported on HDFS files, but the check is happening on any external table as well causing the above error.
To fix this, we should check for encrypted tables only for HDFS tables. And skip the check for any other file schema.
