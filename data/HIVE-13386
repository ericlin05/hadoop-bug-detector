Description

Trying to "select * from table limit 1" from hive table throws:
Failed with exception java.io.IOException:java.lang.NullPointerException
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run spark sql/streaming job, write dataframe with fields that CONTAIN null values (null instead of String/null instead of number) as parquet file.
2. Create external partitioned hive table on top of the parquet files. MSCK repair table.
3. select query returns NPE as described.
Not sure if partitioning is relevant, but the tabled is partitioned by string value.
