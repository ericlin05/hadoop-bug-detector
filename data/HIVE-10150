Description

this query raises an error 
"10297,FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10297]: Attempt to do update or delete on table nonAcidOrcTbl that does not use an AcidOutputFormat or is not bucketed"
even though nonAcidOrcTbl is only being read, not written.
select b from " + Table.ACIDTBL + " where a in (select b from " + Table.NONACIDORCTBL + ")
runs fine.
There doesn't seem to be any logical reason why we should rise the error here.
Same for 'update' statement.
