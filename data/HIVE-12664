Description

The optimisation check for reduce deduplication only checks the first child node for join and the check itself also contains a major bug causing ArrayOutOfBoundException no matter what.
Sample data table form:


time
user
host
path
referer
code
agent
size
method


int

Sample query


SELECT 
  t1.host,
  COUNT(DISTINCT t1.`date`) AS login_count,
  MAX(t2.code) AS code,
  unix_timestamp() AS time
FROM (
    SELECT 
      HOST,
      MIN(time) AS DATE
    FROM
      www_access
    WHERE
      HOST IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      HOST
  ) t1
JOIN (
    SELECT 
      HOST,
      MIN(time) AS code
    FROM
      www_access
    WHERE
      HOST IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
      HOST
  ) t2
  ON t1.host = t2.host
GROUP BY
  t1.host
