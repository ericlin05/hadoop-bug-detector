Description

FAILED: SemanticException 1:68 Percentage sampling is not supported in org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat. Error encountered near token '20'
when I execute
SELECT * FROM tablename TABLESAMPLE(20 percent);
tried with ORC and TEXT tables. Confirmed with Gopal, a temporary workaround is
set hive.tez.input.format=$
{hive.input.format}
;
