Description

Hey Guys,
I created the following table:
CREATE TABLE t1 (id int, key string, value string) partitioned by (dt int);
And after that i created a view on that table as follow:
create view v1 PARTITIONED ON (dt)
as
SELECT * FROM (
SELECT row_number() over (partition by key order by value asc) as row_n, * FROM t1 
) t WHERE row_n = 1;
We are working with hive.mapred.mode=strict and when I try to do the  query select * from v1 where dt = 2 , I'm getting the following error:
FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10041]: No partition predicate found for Alias "v1:t:t1" Table "t1"
Is this a bug or a limitation of Hive when you use analytic functions in partitioned views? If i remove the row_number function it works without problems. 
Thanks in advance, any help will be appreciated.
