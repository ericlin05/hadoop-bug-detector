Description

Currently in QTestGenTask.execute(), we have code like :


       if (logFile != null) {
         File lf = new File(logFile);
         if (lf.exists()) {
           if (!lf.delete()) {
             throw new Exception("Could not delete log file " + lf.getCanonicalPath());
         }


If the log file gets locked due to some other process, it throws the above exception and short circuits the entire test suite. We should provide a mechanism to generate alternative new log files/temporary files whenever possible to avoid unit test failures.
