Description

   For UNION ALL , when an union operator is constant column (such as '0L', BIGINT Type)  and its corresponding column has incompatible type (such as INT type). 
  Query with filter condition on type incompatible column on this UNION ALL  will cause IndexOutOfBoundsException.
 Such as TPC-H table "orders",in  the following query:
 Type of 'orders'.'o_custkey' is INT normally,  while  the type of corresponding constant column  "0" is BIGINT( `0L AS `o_custkey` ). 
 This following query (with filter "type incompatible column 'o_custkey' ")  will fail  with  java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException : 


set hive.cbo.enable=false;
set hive.ppd.remove.duplicatefilters=true;
CREATE TABLE `orders`(
  `o_orderkey` int, 
  `o_custkey` int, 
  `o_orderstatus` string, 
  `o_totalprice` double, 
  `o_orderdate` string, 
  `o_orderpriority` string, 
  `o_clerk` string, 
  `o_shippriority` int, 
  `o_comment` string);

SELECT o_orderkey
FROM   (
              SELECT `o_orderkey` ,
                     `o_custkey`
              FROM   `orders`
              UNION ALL
              SELECT `o_orderkey`,
                     0L  AS `o_custkey`
              FROM   `orders`) `oo`
WHERE  o_custkey&amp;lt;10;
