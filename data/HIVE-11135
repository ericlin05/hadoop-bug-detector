Description

When I run set and save command at Beeline in my environment. And NullPointerException occurred as follows.


[root@hive ~]# /usr/local/hive/bin/beeline
Beeline version 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT by Apache Hive
beeline&amp;gt; !set
java.lang.NullPointerException
beeline&amp;gt; !save
Saving preferences to: /root/.beeline/beeline.properties
java.lang.NullPointerException


This problem has occurred because the following method's return value in BeeLineOpts#toProperties is null.


beeLine.getReflector().invoke(this, "get" + names[i], new Object[0]).toString()


Therefore it is modified so as to avoid NullPointerException.
