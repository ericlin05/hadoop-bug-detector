Description

If the specific location does not exist while creating table,It'll try to make a directory which matches the location.  In the process ,if the location's upper paths also don't exist,It'll find a path "PRTPATH" which is the  specific location's forward path,and then create the missing paths under the PRTPATH.  But It'll check all files' privilege  under the PRTPATH,so even though current user has privilege on the PRTPATH,it'll fail on privilege check
