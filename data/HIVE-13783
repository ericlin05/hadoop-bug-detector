After (accidentally) entering a lonely quote character on its own line and pressing Enter, I get back the normal prompt. This easily makes me believe I'm about to type a new command from scratch, e.g. a select query as in the example, which ends up not working due to parsing error.
Expected behavior: When a previous command is continued, or a quote is opened or anything like this, a differently looking secondary prompt should be displayed rather than the normal prompt; as this is done in e.g. hive, impala, mysql, bash..., e.g.:

# beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000
