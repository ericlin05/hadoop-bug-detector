Description

If the specific location does not exist while creating table, tip information is ambiguous.
&amp;gt; create external table exttbl_bad(id int, name string) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile location '/tmp/tmptbl';
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: HiveAccessControlException Permission denied. Principal [name=admin, type=USER] does not have following privileges on Object [type=DFS_URI, name=/tmp/tmptbl] for operation CREATETABLE : [SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, OBJECT OWNERSHIP] (state=42000,code=40000)
The error message explain that permission to access the path is not satisfied, however, the path does not exist at all.
So it should be reasonable to show message like "path does not exists".
