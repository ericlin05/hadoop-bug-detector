Description

If an HQL query references a struct field with mixed or upper case, Hive throws a NullPointerException instead of giving a better error message or simply lower-casing the name.
For example, if I have a struct in column mystruct with a field named myfield, a query like
select mystruct.MyField from tablename;
passes the local initialize (it submits an M-R job) but the remote initialize jobs throw NullPointerExceptions.  The exception is on line 61 of org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.ExprNodeFieldEvaluator, which is right after the field name is extracted and not forced to be lower-case.
