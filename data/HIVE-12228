Description

The following simple nested query with UDF returns Struct would fail on Hive 0.13.1 . The UDF java code is attached as SimpleStruct.java

ADD JAR simplestruct.jar;
CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION simplestruct AS 'test.SimpleStruct';

SELECT *
  FROM (
    SELECT *
    from mytest
 ) subquery
WHERE simplestruct(subquery.testStr).first


The error message is 

Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: Hive Runtime Error while processing row {"testint":1,"testname":"haha","teststr":"hehe"}
        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.MapOperator.process(MapOperator.java:549)
        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.mr.ExecMapper.map(ExecMapper.java:177)
        ... 8 more

The query works fine if we replace the UDF returns Boolean. By comparing the query plan, we note when using the SimpleStruct UDF, the query plan is 

          TableScan
            Select Operator
              Filter Operator
                Select Operator


The first Select Operator would rename the columns to col_k, which cause this trouble. If we use some UDF returns Boolean, the query plan becomes 

          TableScan
            Filter Operator
              Select Operator


It looks like the Query Planner failed to push down the Filter Operator when the predicate is based on a UDF returns Struct. 
This bug was fixed in Hive 1.2.1, but we cannot find the ticket to fix it.
Appendix: 
The table mytest is created in the following way

CREATE TABLE mytest(testInt INT, testName STRING, testStr STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'test.txt' INTO TABLE mytest;


The file test.txt is a simple CSV file.

1,haha,hehe
2,my,test
