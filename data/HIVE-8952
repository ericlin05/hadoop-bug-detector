Description

1) In the write(final ArrayWritable record) method we should be logging the stack trace as well as the message.
2) We should be passing the caught exception into the arguments of the RuntimeException 
3) Instead of throwing RuntimeException we should throw IllegalArgumentException since it gives some additional semantics (i.e. the argument to this method was the problem)
