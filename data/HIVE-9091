Description

Change the function scope for the functions in HiveSQLException to be private, including 
  toString(Throwable cause, StackTraceElement[] parent) , 
  enroll(Throwable ex, StackTraceElement[] trace, int max),
  toStackTrace(List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; details, StackTraceElement[] parent, int index) 
since these serve as helper function internally. 
Add comments for the public functions in HiveSQLException.
To add additional unit test cases for HiveSQLException such as exception with unknown source, test TStatus conversion, etc.
