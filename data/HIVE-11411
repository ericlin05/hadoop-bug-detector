Description

in method progress(ExecDriverTaskHandle th) of class HadoopJobExecHelper, hive lock heartbeating progress works with job tracking progress. 
such like 
      heartbeater.heartbeat();
      if (initializing &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rj.getJobState() == JobStatus.PREP) 
{
        // No reason to poll untill the job is initialized
        continue;
      }
 else 
{
        // By now the job is initialized so no reason to do
        // rj.getJobState() again and we do not want to do an extra RPC call
        initializing = false;
      }
When job tracking progress got any exception in  rj.getJobState() == JobStatus.PREP, will bring  NoSuchLockException(hive client &amp;amp; exception message:No record of lock could be found, may have timed out) to big query job finally.
