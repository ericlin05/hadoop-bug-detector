Description

During Constant Propagation optimization, sometimes a node ends up being added to opToDelete list more than once.
Later in ConstantPropagate transform, we try to delete that operator multiple times, which will cause SemanticException since the node has already been removed in an earlier pass.
The data structure for storing opToDelete is List. We should use Set to avoid the problem.
