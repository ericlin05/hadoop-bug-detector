Description

When hive can't write to the tmpdir you get —as you'd expect— a stack trace.
unfortunately, what you get is a multiple-wrapped stack trace without any details as to what went wrong:


java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Permission denied


This makes finding the root cause somewhat harder than necessary.
It seems to me that

Any IOE raised on failure to create a temp file should be caught and rethrown.
there's no need to wrap a RuntimeException with a {{RuntimeException}.

I can do a patch for this, if people promise to review it and then, perhaps, even commit it.
