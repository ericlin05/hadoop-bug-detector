Description

File systems such as s3, wasp (azure) don't implement Hadoop FileSystem acl functionality.
Hadoop23Shims has code that calls getAclStatus on file systems.
Instead of calling getAclStatus and catching the exception, we can also check FsPermission#getAclBit .
Additionally, instead of catching all exceptions for calls to getAclStatus and ignoring them, it is better to just catch UnsupportedOperationException.
