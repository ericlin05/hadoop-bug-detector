Description

In the non-auth case, calling HiveMetaStoreClient.getPartitionNames() on a non-existent table returns an empty list, rather than NoSuchObjectException.
It looks like currently all of the checking for valid table is being done at the SemanticAnalyzer level, and no such checking done in the API/metastore level.
