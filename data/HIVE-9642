Description

When org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException is thrown for issues like socket timeout, the retry via RetryingMetaStoreClient happens only in certain cases.
Retry happens for the getDatabase call in but not for getAllDatabases().
The reason is RetryingMetaStoreClient checks for TTransportException being the cause for InvocationTargetException. But in case of some calls such as getAllDatabases in HiveMetastoreClient, all exceptions get wrapped in a MetaException. We should remove this unnecessary wrapping of exceptions for certain functions in HMC.
