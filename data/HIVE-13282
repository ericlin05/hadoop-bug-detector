Description

The group by and select operators run into the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when they incorrectly initialize themselves with tag 0 but the incoming tag id is different.


select count(*) from
(select rt1.id from
(select t1.key as id, t1.value as od from tab t1 group by key, value) rt1) vt1
join
(select rt2.id from
(select t2.key as id, t2.value as od from tab_part t2 group by key, value) rt2) vt2
where vt1.id=vt2.id;
