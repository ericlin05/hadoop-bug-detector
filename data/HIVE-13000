Description

When I run query like these I receive unclear exception
hive&amp;gt; SELECT record FROM ctest GROUP BY record.instance_id;
FAILED: SemanticException Error in parsing 
It will be clearer if it would be like:
hive&amp;gt; SELECT record FROM ctest GROUP BY record.instance_id;
FAILED: SemanticException  Expression not in GROUP BY key record
