Description

Oracle does not distinguish between empty strings and NULL,which proves problematic for DataNucleus.
In the event a user creates a table with some property stored as an empty string the table will no longer be accessible.
i.e. TBLPROPERTIES ('serialization.null.format'='')
If they try to select, describe, drop, etc the client prints the following exception.
ERROR ql.Driver: FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10001]: Table not found &amp;lt;table name&amp;gt;
The work around for this was to go into the hive metastore on the Oracle database and replace NULL with some other string. Users could then drop the tables or alter their data to use the new null format they just set.
