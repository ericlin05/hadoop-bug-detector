Description

HIVE-12790 fixes the HMS connection leaking. But seems there is one more connection from CLIService.
The init() function in CLIService will get info from DB but we never close the HMS connection for this service main thread.  

    // creates connection to HMS and thus *must* occur after kerberos login above
    try {
      applyAuthorizationConfigPolicy(hiveConf);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      throw new RuntimeException("Error applying authorization policy on hive configuration: "
          + e.getMessage(), e);
