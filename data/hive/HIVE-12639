Description

Bad predicates can cause SearchArgument creation to throw exception.  For example, filters like where ts = '2014-15-16 17:18:19.20' can throw IllegalArgumentException during SARG creation as timestamp is of wrong format (month is invalid). If SARG creation fails, it should return YES_NO_NULL TruthValue instead of throwing exception.
