Description

TransactionBatchImpl.beginNextTransactionImpl() has

        LockResponse res = msClient.lock(lockRequest);
        if (res.getState() != LockState.ACQUIRED) {
          throw new TransactionError("Unable to acquire lock on " + endPt);
        }


This means that if there are any competing locks already take, this will throw an Exception to client.  This doesn't seem like the right behavior.  It should block.
We could also add TransactionBatch.beginNextTransaction(long timeoutMs) to  give the client more control.
