Description

For every row x column


        int len = (int) lengths.next();
        int offset = 0;
        byte[] bytes = new byte[len];
        while (len &amp;gt; 0) {
          int written = stream.read(bytes, offset, len);
          if (written &amp;lt; 0) {
            throw new EOFException("Can't finish byte read from " + stream);
          }

This is not a big issue until it misses the GC TLAB.
From hadoop-2.6.x (HADOOP-10855) you can read into a Text directly. 
Possibly can create a different TreeReader from the factory for 2.6.x &amp;amp; use a DataInputStream per stream and prevent an allocation in the inner loop.


        int len = (int) lengths.next();
        result.readWithKnownLength(datastream, len);
