Description

It might be another possible cause to org.datanucleus.exceptions.NucleusObjectNotFoundException: No such database row in drops and retries. 
The rollback might also fail for some reason (e.g. same as that for commit), and the detached objects should also be evicted for same reason as HIVE-3826. 
The evictAll needs to be put in the finally block.
