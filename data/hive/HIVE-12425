Description


public void close(boolean abort) throws IOException {
    if (abort) {
      if (flushLengths == null) {
        fs.delete(path, false);
      }
    } else {
      if (writer != null) writer.close();
    }
    if (flushLengths != null) {
      flushLengths.close();
      fs.delete(getSideFile(path), false);
    }
    writer = null;
  }


While the assumption is that the last txn writing to this file to commit would have called flush(), this still leaves the file open.
