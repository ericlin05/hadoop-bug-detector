Description

Making strict mode the default recently appears to have broken many normal queries, such as some TPCDS benchmark queries, e.g. Q85:
Response message: org.apache.hive.service.cli.HiveSQLException: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10041]: No partition predicate found for Alias "web_sales" Table "web_returns"
We should remove this restriction from strict mode, or change the default back to non-strict. Perhaps make a 3-value parameter, nonstrict, semistrict, and strict, for backward compat for people who are relying on strict already.
