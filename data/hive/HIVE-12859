Description

Hi,
For large number of partitions (specifically, when number of present directories is higher than 1.000.000) msck repair table gives the error from hive cli:
"FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask"
The exception is taken from also beeline cli:
Getting log thread is interrupted, since query is done!
Error: Error while processing statement: FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask (state=08S01, code=1)
java.sql.SQLException: Error while processing statement: FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask
