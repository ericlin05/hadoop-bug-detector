Description

When HS2 is down and a query is run, the following error is shown in beeline:


0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000&amp;gt; show tables;
Error: org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException (state=08S01,code=0)


It may be more helpful to also indicate that the reason for this is that HS2 is down, such as:


0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000&amp;gt; show tables;
HS2 may be unavailable, check server status
Error: org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException (state=08S01,code=0)
