Description

Here are the steps to reproduce. Please setup two hive warehouses with hive.metastore.event.listeners set to org.apache.hive.hcatalog.listener.DbNotificationListener. On warehouse 1, please do the following as user hive.


## create table
CREATE TABLE page_view4(viewTime INT, userid BIGINT,
     page_url STRING, referrer_url STRING,
     ip STRING COMMENT 'IP Address of the User')
 COMMENT 'This is the page view table'
 PARTITIONED BY(dt STRING, country STRING)
 STORED AS SEQUENCEFILE;

## Add partitions
alter table page_view4 add partition (dt="1", country="usa");
alter table page_view4 add partition (dt="2", country="india");
insert into table page_view4 PARTITION (dt="1", country="usa") VALUES (1, 1, "url1", "referurl1", "ip1");

## Export table
export table page_view4 to '/tmp/export4' for replication('foo');


'/tmp/export4' is created with owner as hive and group hdfs. The 
'/apps/hive/warehouse/page_view4/' is created with owner hive and group users. 
Copy the exported data in  '/tmp/export4' to hdfs in warehouse 2. The data is still owned by hive and belongs to group hdfs. Please change the group for dir '/tmp/export4' to users. 


bash# su - hdfs
hdfs : bash# hadoop fs -chown -R hive:users /tmp/export4


As user hive, do the following


hive&amp;gt; import table page_view4 from '/tmp/export4' ;
Copying data from hdfs://node-4.example.com:8020/tmp/export4/dt=1/country=usa
....
Loading data to table default.page_view4 partition (country=usa, dt=1)
Failed with exception org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: org.apache.thrift.protocol.TProtocolException: Required field 'filesAdded' is unset! Struct:InsertEventRequestData(filesAdded:null)
FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.MoveTask


The import failed. Attaching the logs from /tmp/hive/hive.log for further debugging.
