Description

Java1.8u60 and higher cause Joda Time 2.5 to incorrectly format timezones, which leads to the aws server rejecting requests with the aws sdk hadoop3.0 uses. This means any queries involving the s3a connector will return the following AmazonS3Exception:


com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.AmazonS3Exception: AWS authentication requires a valid Date or x-amz-date header


The fix for this is to update Joda Time from 2.5 to 2.8.1. See here for details:
