Description

Hive supports Validator class which allows you to specify valid ranges for various configuration variables.  
There is Validator.validate() which checks that the value specified is actually within the constraints.
Unfortunately validate() is not called in general.
Should make validate() throw IllegalArgumentException and override
Configuration.set() to make sure validate() is always called.
This would not be backwards compatible but we should do what we can to ensure that Hive is configured properly before starting a service.
