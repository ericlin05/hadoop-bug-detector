Description

We are getting a lot of SQL errors reported at SQL Server end. Our set up is a Two Node Hive cluster using SQL Server as MetaStore.
Here is a snippet of SQL Server errors
Invalid object name 'v$instance'. Caused by: SELECT version FROM v$instance
Must declare the scalar variable "@@session".Caused by: SET @@session.sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES
This is filling our logs at a very rapid rate, which we are forced to purge. 
Please note these queries are for MySQL / Oracle.
