Description

To support display of live operations in the WebUI, we record SQLOperations (in liveSqlOperations). 
However, to support historic operations, we save all operations in historicSqlOperations, including non-SQLOperations which do not have display entries in liveSqlOperations.
This leads to a race condition depending on whether sessions use non-sql operations. Reproduce-able by issuing a 'set' operation.

We should save only SQLOperations in historicSqlOperations.
