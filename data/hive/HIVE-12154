Description

We are using flume to sink data to HDFS directory '/tmp/test/', temporal files that flume actively writes into has a suffix .tmp, after writes finish, the file will be renamed to SAMPLE.data.
Hive periodic task execute script like 

load data inpath '/tmp/test/*.data' into table t1;
This exception happens sometimes

I digged into the code, and found that SQLStdHiveAuthorizationValidator checks all the files in /tmp/test/ directory, but when checks the permission of .tmp file, the file is renamed to .data, hdfs cannot find this file.
