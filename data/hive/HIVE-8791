Description

If Hive permission inheritance is turned on, ACL's are inherited from parent directories.  However, on s3 file system, ACL is not supported.
Hence Hive throws the following exception if hadoop is configured with "dfs.namenode.acls.enabled":

FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. MetaException(message:java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: NativeS3FileSystem doesn't support getAclStatus)


  Workaround is to set this flag to false.
