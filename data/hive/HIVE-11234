Description

Cross product in HiveJoinToMultiJoinRule needs to be reconsidered. Now the following explain query will fail at L1116 StatsRulesProcFactory : FAILED: IndexOutOfBoundsException Index: 0, Size: 0 because the key in one of the branches of the join is empty.


explain select *  from src 
where src.key not in (select key  from src1);


If we run


select *  from src 
where src.key not in (select key  from src1);


we will have "FAILED: Execution Error, return code 2 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.mr.MapRedTask". The root cause is the same. Other queries that will also fail include cbo_subq_not_in.q etc.
