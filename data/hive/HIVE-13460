Description

When Hive configured to Store Statistics in MySQL we have next error:

 
2016-04-08 15:53:28,047 ERROR [main]: jdbc.JDBCStatsPublisher (JDBCStatsPublisher.java:init(316)) - Error during JDBC initialization.
com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes


If set MySql properties as:

 
set global innodb_large_prefix = ON;
set global innodb_file_format = BARRACUDA;


Now we have next Error:

 
2016-04-08 15:56:05,552 ERROR [main]: jdbc.JDBCStatsPublisher (JDBCStatsPublisher.java:init(316)) - Error during JDBC initialization.
com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Specified key was too long; max key length is 3072 bytes


 As a result of my investigation I figured out that MySQL does not allow to create primary key with size more than 3072 bytes.
