Description

if a user does not have permission to create table in hive , then if the same user import data for a table using following command then , it will have to create table also and that is working successfully , ideally it should not work
STR:
====
1. put some raw data in hdfs path /user/user1/tempdata
2. in ranger check policy , user1 should not have any permission on any table
3. login through user1 into beeline ( obviously it will fail since user doesnt have permission to create table)
create table tt1(id INT,ff String);
FAILED: HiveAccessControlException Permission denied: user user1 does not have CREATE privilege on default/tt1 (state=42000,code=40000)
4. now try following command to import data into a table ( table should not exist already)
import table tt1 from '/user/user1/tempdata';
ER:
since user1 doesnt have permission to create table so this operation should fail
AR:
table is created successfully and data is also imported !!
