Description

When dropping an external table with its data located in an encryption zone, hive should not throw out MetaException(message:Unable to drop table because it is in an encryption zone and trash is enabled. Use PURGE option to skip trash.) in checkTrashPurgeCombination since the data should not get deleted (or trashed) anyway regardless HDFS Trash is enabled or not.
