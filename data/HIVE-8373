Description

I have a straigh forward query to run in Spark local mode, but get an OOM even though the data volumn is tiny:


Exception in thread "Spark Context Cleaner" 
Exception: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError thrown from the UncaughtExceptionHandler in thread "Spark Context Cleaner"
Exception in thread "Executor task launch worker-1" 
Exception: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError thrown from the UncaughtExceptionHandler in thread "Executor task launch worker-1"
Exception in thread "Keep-Alive-Timer" 
Exception: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError thrown from the UncaughtExceptionHandler in thread "Keep-Alive-Timer"
Exception in thread "Driver Heartbeater" 
Exception: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError thrown from the UncaughtExceptionHandler in thread "Driver Heartbeater"


The query is:


select product_name, avg(item_price) as avg_price from product join item on item.product_pk=product.product_pk group by product_name order by avg_price;
